LDIF to VCARD File Conversion Utility

This is a simple command line Perl script I wrote in order to migrate my Netscape address book to GnomeCard. It takes an LDIF file, as exported from Netscape, and writes out a VCARD file. Currently the first name, last name, work, home and cell phone numbers and email address is written. The input file may be either DOS or unix text format.

2016/03/10 - small change in the original script (done by D. Scott Barninger) to include the contact photography.
